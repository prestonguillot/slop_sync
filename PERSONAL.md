# Personal post-bootstrap setup

`setup-new-machine.md` covers the genesys framework. This file covers the steps specific to my (Preston's) personal layer — tools installed via my Brewfile that have post-install configuration not handled by `brew install` alone.

Run any of these you need after `./scripts/bootstrap` completes.

## GitHub auth (`gh`)

My `home/.gitconfig` configures git to use the `gh` CLI as its credential helper for github.com and gist.github.com. For that to work, you have to authenticate gh once per machine:

```fish
gh auth login
```

Pick HTTPS, authorize in the browser. After this, `git push`/`git pull` to private GitHub repos works without prompts for the lifetime of the token.

If on a given machine you'd rather use a different credential strategy (osxkeychain alone, SSH, etc.), edit `home/.gitconfig` to drop the `!gh auth git-credential` lines.

## Link openjdk so `java` actually works

`openjdk` (and its dependent `sbt`) are in my Brewfile, but Homebrew can't symlink the JDK into `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` without root. After `brew bundle install`:

```fish
sudo ln -sfn "$(brew --prefix)/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk" \
              /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
```

Run this **in a real terminal** — `sudo` needs a TTY for the password prompt.

Verify: `java --version` should print something like `openjdk 26.x.x …`.

If you don't actually want Java on a given machine, remove `brew "openjdk"` and `brew "sbt"` from the Brewfile and uninstall them.

## Install a Node version (`fnm`)

`fnm` is wired into `config.fish` (`fnm env --use-on-cd | source`) so node-version auto-switching works in any directory with a `.nvmrc` or `.node-version`. But fnm doesn't ship with a node; install one once:

```fish
fnm install --lts
fnm default lts-latest
```

`node --version` should report the LTS now.

## Mac App Store

Sign into the App Store app with the Apple ID that originally purchased my MAS apps (currently just Fantastical, `id: 975937182`). `brew bundle install` will skip MAS lines for unowned apps with a warning rather than failing.

## Neovim plugin bootstrap (LazyVim)

`home/.config/nvim/` is a LazyVim config. On first run after stow, neovim bootstraps lazy.nvim (git clone) and then installs all plugins — this can take 30–60 seconds and the screen will show install progress. Just let it finish; subsequent launches are normal.

```fish
nvim
```

When the lazy.nvim UI closes and the normal editor appears, plugins are installed.

## Fisher plugins

`fish_plugins` (tracked in the repo, symlinked into `~/.config/fish/`) lists `jorgebucaran/fisher` itself plus `fzf.fish`, `autopair.fish`, and `sponge`. Bootstrap installs fisher but doesn't auto-install the plugins. One-liner:

```fish
fish -c 'fisher update'
```

Wrangle's fisher-drift pass on the next run will also notice any missing-from-installed plugins and offer to install them per-item.
